              The chapter was started to bridge the gap between what students learn in lectures and what actually gets used in the real world. Most engineering education stops at the theory. We try to go the rest of the way — prototyping, testing in conditions, and handing off systems that communities can operate independently.

                  At HITAM, most student clubs organize talks and workshops. We do those too — but the chapter's real work happens in project teams where students own an outcome from conception to deployment.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We run lean. Project teams are small (5–8 people), timelines are semester-based, and there's a real expectation that you'll ship something. The accountability is what makes it valuable.

                  We're embedded in the IUCEE network, which means we have access to cross-institution collaboration, national-level competitions, and faculty mentorship beyond our own campus.
